        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <div class="history-columns">
          <div class="history-text">
            <p>
              Founded in 2015, Rapidis Rafting began as a small group of passionate river guides who dreamed of sharing the excitement of whitewater rafting with the world. With just a single raft and a deep love for adventure, we launched our first tours along the Nile River, offering unforgettable experiences to thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike.

                As word spread about our safe, professional, and fun-filled trips, our team grew — and so did our reputation. By 2018, we had expanded our operations, added new routes, upgraded our gear, and began offering specialized packages for families, schools, and corporate teams.

                  Despite rapid growth, our mission has remained the same: to deliver world-class rafting adventures that connect people with nature, challenge their limits, and create lifelong memories.

                  Today, Rapidis Rafting is proud to be one of the leading rafting companies in the region, with a legacy built on trust, safety, and a deep respect for the rivers we ride</p>

                    <p>
                    At Rapidis Rafting, we believe that rafting is more than just fun — it helps people learn and grow. We think that when people go on adventures in nature, they become stronger, more confident, and happier.

                    Our theory is based on three main ideas:

                    Safety first  We always make sure our guides are trained and our equipment is safe. This helps everyone enjoy the ride without worry.

                    Respect nature we love the river and the environment. We teach our guests how to take care of nature while having fun.

                    Teamwork and fun Rafting helps people work together, make new friends, and have a great time.

                    We believe that every trip down the river is a chance to enjoy life, learn something new, and create amazing memories.</p>
